# PointerNames
Give your c/c++ pointers names.
### About
This tool will offer you functions to map every pointer address to a name to give you redable and maby more important compareable output.

### How to use it?
Just call the defaultPointerToNames() or pointerToNames(char\[\]\[10\]) to initialise the framework with default or custom names and you are ready to use the getName(void*) function.

### Installation
Look in the release. There will be a PointerNames.h file. Download it and place it into your project and you are ready to include it.
If you want the latest development version look in the src directory.
